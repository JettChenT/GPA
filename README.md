The source code of this tool is contained in this repository. Feel free to check it out and contribute!

## Privacy
Our server does not store any information/statistics regarding your gpa score.
When you share your GPA score with other via an url, all the data related to your GPA data is stored in the URL itself, 
hence why the shared URL is so long.

To estimate the amount of resources to be spent on maintaining this, we keep track of the amount of visitors to our website.
You can view the data (here)[https://analytics.ssbs.club/share/xcOczTBw/GPA]. Now you have as much information as we do :)

## Mobile version
The mobile version(a miniprogram on wechat) is coming soon!
